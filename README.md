  Description: This project is a simple yet effective FIFA tournament generator designed to manage a 4-person tournament. It offers two exciting modes: a group stage and a knockout stage. In the group stage, each player competes against the others, with points awarded based on match results, leading to a final ranking. The knockout stage, on the other hand, pits players against each other in a single-elimination format, where only the strongest advance to the next round. This generator automates matchups, tracks results, and ensures a smooth tournament experience, making it perfect for casual FIFA tournaments with friends.
